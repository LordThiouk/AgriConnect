## Completed Milestones

### ✅ **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Project Context** - COMPLETED
- [x] Environment Check: Project initialized in Expo/React Native with folder structure
- [x] Supabase Connection: Verified via `lib/supabase.ts` with public key and URL
- [x] Data Retrieval: Tested fetching producer/plot data from Supabase
- [x] Migrations: Verified presence in `supabase/migrations/`
- [x] Cursor Metrics: Created `cursor_metrics.md` for project rule tracking

### ✅ **Phase 2: Frontend Development (Producteurs & Agents)** - COMPLETED
- [x] Navigation: Verified Expo Router functionality (`_layout.tsx`, `(auth)/login.tsx`, `(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- [x] Components: Integrated `FormField.tsx` and `KpiCard.tsx` in producer and agent screens
- [x] Dashboard: Added **plot status display** and alerts on `dashboard.tsx`
- [x] Profile: Added history display (plots, observations, advice) in `profile.tsx`
- [x] Agent Dashboard: Created table showing followed producers, complete forms, plots to visit
- [x] Offline Sync: Simulated offline field collection and verified automatic sync after reconnection

### ✅ **Phase 3: Backend Supabase** - COMPLETED
- [x] Tables: Created `profiles`, `producers`, `parcels`, `observations`, `operations`, `recommendations`
- [x] GPS & Photos: Added fields for GPS tracking and photos (Supabase storage)
- [x] Edge Function: Created `process_alerts()` for automatic alert generation (`agri_rules`)
- [x] RLS: Implemented Row Level Security for data access by role (agent, producer, admin)

### ✅ **Phase 4: Data Collection & Observations** - COMPLETED
- [x] Collection: In `collecte/add.tsx`, enabled adding producer/plot offline
- [x] Operations: Added form for operations (sowing, fertilization, irrigation, harvest)
- [x] Observations: Added observations with photos + severity (1–5)
- [x] Sync Validation: Verified data syncs correctly after network restoration

### ✅ **Phase 5: Notifications & Advice** - COMPLETED
- [x] SMS via Twilio: After collection recording or critical alerts
- [x] Push Notifications: Via `expo-notifications` for fertilization reminders or diseases
- [x] Admin Interface: For sending targeted campaigns (by crop/region)

### ✅ **Phase 6: Web App Admin/Supervisor** - COMPLETED
- [x] Admin Panel: Created (React + Supabase Web App) for:
  - Validating agent data
  - Following stats (producers, plots, operations)
  - Supervising alerts and recommendations
  - Exporting reports (PDF/Excel)

### ✅ **Phase 7: Testing & Stabilization** - COMPLETED
- [x] Manual Tests: In Expo Go (mobile) and browser (Web App)
- [x] Complete Flow: Tested: add producer → add plot → observation → alert
- [x] Offline Simulation: Simulated network absence and verified offline sync
- [x] RLS Verification: Verified agent can only see associated producers

### ✅ **Phase 8: MVP Launch** - COMPLETED
- [x] APK Generation: Generated + distributed internally (private Play Store/test)
- [x] Landing Page: Prepared + user documentation (agents, producers)
- [x] Initial Communication: Towards partner cooperatives

### ✅ **Phase 9: API Routes Implementation and Testing** - COMPLETED
- [x] **Edge Functions API Structure**: Comprehensive API with shared utilities and types
- [x] **Authentication System**: OTP verification and JWT tokens implementation
- [x] **Producers API**: Full CRUD operations with role-based access control
- [x] **Validation Schemas**: Zod validation for all API endpoints
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete API endpoint documentation
- [x] **Testing Framework**: Test scripts for automated API testing
- [x] **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP codes
- [x] **Development Setup**: Local testing capabilities with Supabase

### ✅ **Phase 10: API Deployment and Testing** - COMPLETED
- [x] **API Implementation Complete**: Edge Functions Supabase with modular architecture
- [x] **Shared TypeScript Types**: Interfaces for all agricultural entities
- [x] **Shared Utilities**: Common functions (auth, validation, CORS, pagination)
- [x] **Zod Validation**: Robust validation schemas for all inputs
- [x] **Production Deployment**: Auth function deployed and accessible
- [x] **API Testing**: Production endpoints validated and functional
- [x] **CORS Configuration**: Complete cross-origin request support
- [x] **Error Management**: Standardized responses and appropriate HTTP codes
- [x] **Simplified Authentication**: Email/password for development
- [x] **JWT Token Generation**: Simplified tokens for development
- [x] **Input Validation**: Email/password verification
- [x] **CORS Security**: Appropriate headers

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: API Deployment and Testing - COMPLETED  
**Next Phase**: Complete API Deployment and Frontend Integration

- [ ] Implement authentication in applications
- [ ] Handle loading and error states
- [ ] Test complete user flows

### **Medium Term (Week 3)**
- [ ] Complete integration tests
- [ ] Performance and load testing
- [ ] Query and cache optimization
- [ ] Production preparation
