## üåæ Real-World Agricultural Workflow Validated

### **Complete Data Journey**:
1. **Cooperative** creates farm files for producers
2. **Producers** have plots with GPS coordinates and soil data
3. **Crops** are planted with variety, sowing dates, and area tracking
4. **Operations** (semis, fertilisation, irrigation) are logged with dates
5. **Observations** (lev√©e, ravageurs, maladies) are recorded with severity
6. **Rules Engine** automatically evaluates conditions and triggers alerts
7. **Recommendations** are generated with personalized messages
8. **Notifications** are created for SMS delivery to farmers/agents

### **Example Generated Alert**:
```
üö® Test Alert - Fertilisation Urgente
Bonjour Test, il est temps de fertiliser votre culture de ma√Øs. 
Appliquez 200kg d'engrais NPK 15-15-15 par hectare dans les prochains jours.
Priority: URGENT
```
