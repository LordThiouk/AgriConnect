## 🚨 Critical Findings

### **✅ STRENGTHS**
1. **Robust Schema**: All foreign key relationships working perfectly
2. **Data Integrity**: CHECK constraints preventing invalid data
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle multiple cooperatives, producers, crops
4. **Rule Flexibility**: SQL-based rules allow complex agricultural logic
5. **Notification Ready**: Infrastructure prepared for multi-channel delivery

### **⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**
1. **RLS Policies**: Need refinement for production user access
2. **Error Handling**: Could benefit from more descriptive error messages
3. **Performance**: Consider indexing for large-scale operations
4. **Audit Trail**: Could add more detailed logging for compliance

### **🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT**
1. **Service Key Dependency**: Currently using service keys to bypass RLS
2. **Manual Rule Evaluation**: Rules need automated scheduling
3. **Notification Delivery**: Twilio integration pending
